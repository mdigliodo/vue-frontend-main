Your goal is to solve the technical tasks proposed in the different views. Each challenge view will contain the necessary technical details for its development, but if you have any doubts in any of them, contact us and we will resolve it as soon as possible.',

There is no single way to solve the exercises; donâ€™t fall into infinite improvement loopsâ€”<strong>beyond assessing knowledge, we want to understand how you work</strong>. Feel free to use whatever you consider best for each situation.',

We have prepared our testing stack for you: Playwright, Vitest, and Vue Testing Library. You can use it or not, but if you do, we will value it positively. Nothing complexâ€”just an idea of how you might structure your tests.",
