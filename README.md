# Ambar Vue Challenge

A straightforward project built with **Vue 3** and **TailwindCSS**. The objective is to complete the technical tasks presented in each view. Each challenge view includes all the relevant technical details required for its implementation.

## Motivation

The Ambar Vue Challenge was created as a technical assessment for candidates applying to our company. Its purpose is to evaluate practical skills in **Vue 3, TailwindCss, Unit Test and E2E Test with Playwright**, problem-solving abilities, and code quality in a real-world scenario.
